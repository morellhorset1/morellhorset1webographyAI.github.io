            <td>Starting in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, AI research gained momentum. Key events like IBM’s Deep Blue beating chess champion Gary Kasparov showed AI’s potential beyond fiction. Today, AI impacts numerous industries: from personalized education tools and improved medical diagnostics to automated financial services and even law. Looking forward, AI is expected to speed up decision-making in businesses, challenge privacy, and lead to more automation. While AI offers massive efficiency gains, it also raises concerns, including potential job displacement and privacy risks. Many believe that "human-AI teaming" will be crucial to maintain control and leverage AI responsibly. Also, AI will affect countless industries in the future and will be able to grow these industries.

            <td>AI is enhancing human abilities and disrupting traditional ways of life, with code-driven systems now touching more than half the world’s population. As algorithmic AI expands, experts debate whether its growth will ultimately help or harm society. In a 2018 survey, 63% of nearly 1,000 tech experts and leaders believed that AI would improve lives by 2030, predicting advancements in healthcare, personalized education, and efficient processes. They saw AI saving time, money, and even lives through “smart” systems in sectors such as medicine, transportation, and agriculture. Still, 37% of respondents worried that AI could lead to serious societal challenges. Privacy emerged as a key concern, as AI’s reliance on vast amounts of data raises the risk of surveillance and data misuse. Some experts stressed that AI’s future impact depends on how responsibly it’s regulated and integrated.</td>
