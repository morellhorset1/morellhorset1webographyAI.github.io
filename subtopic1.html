	            <td>North Carolina teacher Leila Wheless tried using AI in her middle school classroom but found it frustrating. For a project on the book Persepolis, she asked students to research prophets. However, AI gave strange answers, like saying Moses removed chocolate stains from shirts, which students accepted without question. Teachers nationwide share similar concerns: students often rely on AI for easy answers, missing chances to develop critical thinking. Some teachers now use in-class assignments and customized questions to reduce AI dependence. While AI can speed up simple tasks, many teachers are cautious, adapting their lessons to encourage students to think more independently.</td>

	            <td>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming education by providing tools to enhance teaching and learning. A 2023 Forbes Advisor survey of 500 U.S. educators highlights AI's growing influence in classrooms. Teachers at various career stages shared insights into how AI tools, such as adaptive learning platforms, AI-powered educational games, and automated grading systems, are being integrated into education. These tools offer benefits like customized learning, immediate feedback, and freeing up educators' time by handling administrative tasks. Additionally, intelligent tutoring systems and chatbots provide students with academic support, from answering admissions queries to assisting with assignments. Over half of the surveyed educators view AI positively, with many younger teachers leading the adoption of AI in classrooms.
